CORRECTED ENTERPRISE TRIAL SYSTEM TEST
======================================

This test verifies the CORRECTED enterprise trial system:

1. NEW USERS: Get 7-day APP-MANAGED trial (no Stripe involvement)
2. TRIAL USERS UPGRADING: Get immediate paid subscription (trial_days=0)
3. ADMIN USERS: Unlimited access without subscription checks

Test Scenarios:
- New user registration → Gets 7-day trial
- Trial user upgrading → Immediate paid subscription
- Admin user access → Unlimited access
