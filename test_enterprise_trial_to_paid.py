ENTERPRISE TRIAL-TO-PAID UPGRADE TEST
=====================================

This test verifies that the enterprise trial-to-paid upgrade logic works correctly:

1. Users on trial who subscribe should get IMMEDIATE paid access
2. NO additional trial days should be granted
3. Status should transition from "trial" to "active" immediately
4. Frontend should show appropriate messaging

Test Scenarios:
- User with 6 days trial left subscribes → Immediate "active" status
- User with 1 day trial left subscribes → Immediate "active" status  
- User with expired trial subscribes → Immediate "active" status
