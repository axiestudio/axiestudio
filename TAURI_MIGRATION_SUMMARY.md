# Tauri v2 Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated from Docker-based GitHub Actions workflows to Tauri v2 desktop application builds. This change transforms AxieStudio from a web-only application to a cross-platform desktop application that can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Docker Workflows
Deleted the following Docker-related GitHub Actions workflows:
- `docker-build.yml` - Main Docker build and push workflow
- `docker-image.yml` - Docker image CI workflow  
- `docker-swedish-backend.yml` - Backend-specific Docker workflow
- `docker_test.yml` - Docker testing workflow

### 2. Created Tauri Configuration
Set up complete Tauri v2 project structure:

#### `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
- Configured for AxieStudio v1.5.0
- Set up build commands to use existing frontend build process
- Configured window properties (1200x800 default, resizable)
- Set up security CSP for local development
- Configured bundle settings for all platforms

#### `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
- Tauri v2 dependencies
- Shell plugin for opening external links
- Serde for JSON serialization
- Tokio for async runtime

#### `src-tauri/src/main.rs`
- Basic Tauri application entry point
- Greet command example
- Splashscreen handling
- Shell plugin integration

#### `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`
- Library entry point for mobile builds (future-ready)
- Shared command handlers

#### `src-tauri/build.rs`
- Tauri build script configuration

### 3. New GitHub Actions Workflow
Created `tauri-build.yml` with the following features:

#### Multi-Platform Support
- **Windows**: x64 builds with MSI installer
- **macOS**: Both Intel (x86_64) and Apple Silicon (ARM64) builds with DMG
- **Linux**: x64 builds with AppImage and DEB packages

#### Trigger Conditions
- Manual dispatch with version and pre-release options
- Automatic builds on push to master/main branches
- Pull request builds (as drafts)
- Ignores documentation-only changes

#### Build Process
1. Checkout repository
2. Install platform-specific dependencies
3. Setup Node.js with npm caching
4. Install Rust with target-specific toolchains
5. Cache Rust build artifacts
6. Install and build frontend dependencies
7. Build Tauri application with tauri-action@v0

#### Release Management
- Automatic GitHub releases
- Version tagging (manual or auto-generated)
- Release notes with download instructions
- Draft releases for PRs
- Pre-release support

## Required Setup Steps

### 1. Icon Files
Create the following icon files in `src-tauri/icons/`:
- `32x32.png` - 32x32 pixel PNG
- `128x128.png` - 128x128 pixel PNG  
- `128x128@2x.png` - 256x256 pixel PNG (2x)
- `icon.icns` - macOS icon file
- `icon.ico` - Windows icon file

### 2. GitHub Secrets (Optional)
For code signing, add these secrets to your GitHub repository:
- `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` - Private key for signing
- `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` - Password for private key

### 3. Repository Permissions
Ensure GitHub Actions has write permissions:
1. Go to repository Settings → Actions → General
2. Under "Workflow permissions", select "Read and write permissions"

## Frontend Integration
The Tauri configuration is set up to work with your existing frontend:
- Development: `npm run start` on port 3000
- Build: `npm run build` outputs to `build/` directory
- No changes needed to existing frontend code

## Benefits of Migration

### For Users
- **Native Performance**: Desktop app runs faster than web version
- **Offline Capability**: Can work without internet connection
- **System Integration**: Native file dialogs, notifications, etc.
- **Security**: Sandboxed environment with controlled permissions

### For Development
- **Cross-Platform**: Single codebase for all desktop platforms
- **Modern Stack**: Rust backend with web frontend
- **Smaller Bundle Size**: Tauri apps are typically smaller than Electron
- **Better Security**: Rust's memory safety and Tauri's security model

### For Distribution
- **App Stores**: Can distribute through Microsoft Store, Mac App Store
- **Direct Downloads**: Users get native installers
- **Auto-Updates**: Built-in updater support (can be added later)
- **Code Signing**: Professional app signing support

## Next Steps

1. **Add Real Icons**: Replace placeholder icon files with actual AxieStudio icons
2. **Test Locally**: Install Tauri CLI and test builds locally
3. **Configure Code Signing**: Set up certificates for Windows/macOS signing
4. **Add Auto-Updater**: Implement Tauri's updater plugin
5. **Mobile Support**: Tauri v2 supports iOS/Android (future enhancement)

## Testing the Workflow

To test the new workflow:
1. Push changes to master/main branch, or
2. Go to Actions tab → "Build and Release Tauri App" → "Run workflow"
3. Monitor the build process for all platforms
4. Check the generated release artifacts

The workflow will create a GitHub release with installers for all platforms automatically.
