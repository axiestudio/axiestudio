└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### **1. Enhanced Trial Middleware** (`trial_middleware.py`)

**Purpose**: Core trial status enforcement and access control

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **Admin Bypass**: Superusers get unlimited access
- ✅ **Path-based Protection**: Different rules for different endpoints
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse from trial users
- ✅ **Suspicious Activity Detection**: Identifies potential abuse patterns
- ✅ **Graceful Degradation**: Fails safely if services are unavailable

**Protected Endpoints:**
```python
protected_paths = {
    "/api/v1/flows",           # Core AI/ML functionality
    "/api/v1/files",           # File operations
    "/api/v1/chat",            # Chat/AI features
    "/api/v1/components",      # Component access
    "/api/v1/projects",        # Project management
}
```

**WHY THIS APPROACH:**
- **Revenue Protection**: Blocks access to premium features for expired trials
- **User Experience**: Allows access to essential functions (login, pricing, etc.)
- **Clear Communication**: Provides specific error messages with upgrade paths
- **Performance**: Efficient path matching and caching

### **2. Security Middleware** (`security_middleware.py`)

**Purpose**: Advanced threat detection and rate limiting

**Key Features:**
- 📊 **Multi-tier Rate Limiting**: Different limits for different endpoint types
- 🚨 **IP Reputation System**: Automatic blocking of suspicious IPs
- 🤖 **Bot Detection**: Identifies automated/scripted access attempts
- 📈 **Pattern Analysis**: Detects suspicious usage patterns
- 📝 **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed security event tracking

**Rate Limiting Configuration:**
```python
rate_limits = {
    "global": {"requests": 1000, "window": 300},      # 1000 req/5min globally
    "per_ip": {"requests": 100, "window": 300},       # 100 req/5min per IP
    "auth": {"requests": 10, "window": 300},          # 10 auth attempts/5min
    "signup": {"requests": 5, "window": 3600},        # 5 signups/hour per IP
    "subscription": {"requests": 20, "window": 3600}, # 20 sub requests/hour
}
```

**WHY THESE LIMITS:**
- **Global Limit**: Protects overall system capacity
- **Per-IP Limit**: Prevents individual abuse while allowing normal usage
- **Auth Limit**: Prevents credential stuffing attacks
- **Signup Limit**: Stops automated account creation
- **Subscription Limit**: Protects payment processing from abuse

### **3. Frontend Protection** (`useTrialStatus.ts`, `TrialGuard.tsx`)

**Purpose**: Real-time trial monitoring and user experience optimization

**Key Features:**
- ⏰ **Real-time Monitoring**: Checks trial status every 5 minutes
- 🚨 **Progressive Warnings**: Different urgency levels based on days remaining
- 🔄 **Automatic Redirects**: Seamless redirect to pricing page
- 💬 **Enhanced Messaging**: Clear communication about benefits and next steps
- 🎯 **Conversion Optimization**: Contextual upgrade prompts

**Warning System:**
```typescript
// Last day - critical warning
if (daysLeft === 0) {
  setErrorData({
    title: "🚨 Trial Expires Today!",
    list: [
      "Your free trial expires in less than 24 hours",
      "Subscribe now to avoid service interruption",
      "All your projects and data will be preserved"
    ]
  });
}
```

**WHY THIS UX APPROACH:**
- **User Retention**: Clear warnings prevent surprise service interruptions
- **Conversion Optimization**: Highlights benefits and urgency
- **Data Preservation**: Reassures users their work is safe
- **Smooth Transition**: Contextual redirects with upgrade information

### **4. Abuse Prevention Service** (`abuse_prevention.py`)

**Purpose**: Sophisticated abuse detection and prevention

**Key Features:**
- 🔍 **Device Fingerprinting**: Tracks devices across sessions
- 📧 **Email Analysis**: Detects disposable emails and aliases
- 🌐 **IP Analysis**: Identifies VPNs, proxies, and suspicious ranges
- 📊 **Risk Scoring**: Quantitative abuse risk assessment
- 🚫 **Automatic Blocking**: Blocks high-risk signup attempts

**Risk Assessment Logic:**
```python
if risk_score >= 150:
    action = "block"  # High confidence abuse
elif risk_score >= 100:
    action = "block"  # Likely abuse
elif risk_score >= 75:
    action = "warn"   # Monitor closely
else:
    action = "allow"  # Legitimate user
```

**WHY RISK-BASED APPROACH:**
- **Accuracy**: Reduces false positives while catching real abuse
- **Scalability**: Automated decision making without manual review
- **Adaptability**: Risk thresholds can be adjusted based on patterns
- **User Experience**: Legitimate users aren't impacted

## 📊 MONITORING & ANALYTICS

### **Security Metrics Tracked:**
- Blocked IP addresses and reasons
- Rate limit violations by endpoint
